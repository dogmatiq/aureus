## What is a golden file?

A "golden file" is a file that represents the expected output of some test. When
the test is executed, the output of the system under test is compared to the
content of the golden file â€” if they differ, the test fails.

## What does Aureus do?

Aureus recursively scans directories for golden file tests expressed either as
flat files, or as code blocks within Markdown documents. By default it scans the
`testdata` directory within the current working directory.

### Flat files

Files with names matching the `<group>.input[.<extension>]` and
`<group>.output[.<extension> ` patterns are treated as test inputs and outputs,
respectively.

For each pair of input and output files with the same `<group>` prefix, a
user-defined function is invoked. The function must produce output that matches
the content of the output file, otherwise the test fails.

The [`run_test.go`] illustrates how to use Aureus to execute the flat-file tests
in the [`testdata`] directory.

### Markdown documents

As an alternative to (or in combination with) flat-file tests, Aureus can load
inputs and outputs from [fenced code blocks] within Markdown documents.

Code blocks annotated with the `au:input` or `au:output` attribute are treated
as a test input or output, respectively. The `au:group` attribute is used to
group the inputs and outputs.

This file is itself an example of a Markdown-based test. It confirms the
behavior of a basic JSON pretty-printer. Given this unformatted JSON value:

```json au:input au:group=json-pretty-printer
{ "one": 1, "two": 2 }
```

We expect our formatter function to produce the following output:

```json au:output au:group=json-pretty-printer
{
  "one": 1,
  "two": 2
}
```

View the [README source] to see how the code blocks are annotated for use with
Aureus, and [`run_test.go`] to see how to execute the
tests.
